## Aims and Principles of Sepro

For the development process of the system, we are adhering to several
principles that help us during design decision process. 

* Completeness and clarity of model description
* Minimal set of assumptions
* Iterative simulation and parallel in nature
* No explicitly guaranteed control flow
* System has to be observable and measurable
* Strict separation of control environment and internal computation state

One aim that we would like to achieve is: _the system and the model should be
translate-able into physical biological equivalent_. However, given knowledge
and state of the matters in the field, we might only have assumptions 

## Focus on observation

* Emergence of behavioural patterns
* Interactions of behavioural patterns through their effects
* Evolutionary transformations of information structures
* Effects of fluctuations and fluctuation induced behavioural and structural novelties

In general we can say, that we are more concerned about the  instabilities as
opposed to equilibria. We rather want to study amplification of fluctuations
instead of central tendencies.
