# Future

This chapter lists opportunities for further development of the system.

### Undocumented

Already designed or explored but undocumented features and uses of the system:

* Virtual laboratory experimentation – what are the possibilities of
  simulation experiments? What are virtual pipettes? How to perform
  comparative analysis of simulation outcomes? How to control the experiments
  through automated decisioning process?

### Untested

The topics that can be tested using already designed or explored ideas:

* How the simulation order influences the outcome of the simulation? What is
  the relationship between simulation methods and group of model problems?
  Which methods are better or worse for specific model problems and why? What
  are the overall recommendations for the simulated order?

### Unexplored

Topics that are known to be explored and are expected to be part of the system in the future:

* Structural alterations – conceptual specification and implementation
  recommendation for object instance creation and deletion and for object
  structure alteration.
* Physical and other constraints – how the physical properties are modelled and
  how they can be integrated with the simulation system
* Model primitives and model libraries – the structural and behavioural
  primitives and shareable repositories of domain specific concepts

Sepro system is not considered complete without the structural alterations
which are essential to the intended modelling and simulation principles.
